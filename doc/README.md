- a coder's lament on the paucity of `java.lang.String` functionality

This is an RFC for future/ enhancement of `java.lang.String` - was Fwd: [Yaml-core] encoding and content in `YML` files



From root dir of the repo, to get `jc` (java compile) alias etc:
    . conf/env

then build e.g.:
    jc src/java/zen/lang/CodePointCursor.java
    jc src/java/zen/lang/CodePointParser.java
